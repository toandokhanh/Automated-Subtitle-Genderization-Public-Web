1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
When people look at me, they see what they want to see, and that comes with a lot of expectations.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,480
I know what it's like to be judged, to be put down.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,680
I know what it's like to have other people form opinions of you without even knowing

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
you, trying to dim your light.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,440
I want to say you are not defined by an Instagram photo, by a like, by a comment.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,240
That does not define you.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,920
I want you guys to know that the trick is to focus on the love.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,240
And what I want you guys to do, every rude comment you get, every person that tries to

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,320
hurt you personally or through the internet, I want you to forgive them.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,800
Just forgive them, because they don't even know.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,920
They have no idea.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,200
There is so much love in this world and in this stadium.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,840
Don't limit yourself because of what others expect.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,960
We all deserve more than we think.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,240
In the end, nobody remembers those haters, the comments.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Nobody remembers them.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,840
They're just background noise.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,400
When it's over, nothing defines you, but what you leave behind and what lives you touch

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
on the way.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,480
But I'm so grateful for what I have, and I am ready for what comes next in my life.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,560
If you take just one thing from today, let it be this.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,600
I want you guys to believe in yourselves because I believe in you and you guys need to believe

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
in each other.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,440
So just do you.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
Be true to yourself.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Love yourself.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
Have confidence in yourself and everything will be fine.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
I am so excited for what's going to come next for you guys.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,440
Thank you so much.
